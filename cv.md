## SUMMARY
My name is Anna. I'am software engineer with 4 years of experience. Personally, I treat my work as a creative activity and I love it. Programming is similar to solving puzzles or riddles. A client appears and says: "I want this and this!". And you start thinking, looking for options, so that you can code and find the solution..
